# Windwaker-Bombgame

## This is a recreation of a bomb game in the videogame The Legend of Zelda Windwaker

#### Essentially the game is a one player battleship, where there are 3 "squid" or "targets" you are trying to hit with the limited amount of bombs you have in a grid pane. 

#### The 3 targets are a large squid (4x1 spaces), a medium squid (3x1 spaces), and a small squid (2x1 spaces). 

This was written in python as a personal project for me to get more comfortable writing code in Python and learning about the GUI functionality Tkinter offers for Python.

To run:
You must have Python3 installed
  - If you do not have it installed and you have a linux machine, you can run ">sudo apt-get install python3.6"

Then run the "ship.py" file with command ">python3 ship.py"
